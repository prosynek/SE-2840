I enjoyed this lab a lot. Specifically, I enjoyed using and API and making API requests to get data and then continuing to make requests in the background to display updated information. Throughout this lab, I was able to gain a better understanding of, and experience using Promises and the fetch API. As a result, I now feel more comfortable using both of these. One thing that I think could be improved about this lab is requiring that we have to mark the user's current location on the map. I added this feature to my project because I thought it was kind of fun and somewhat exciting to access my current location from the web browser, especially since this is a feature of many maps apps like Google Maps. The most difficult part of this lab was getting started. When I started this lab, I struggled with what to implement first, so a possible improvement to the lab document could be a list of reccommendations of what aspects of the project to tackle first.
